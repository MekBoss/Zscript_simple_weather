/*
this file defines weather type for a specific map

To define weather for specific map you should use
map "level number"
{
    weather = snow/rain/ash; <- semicolon at the end important!!!!!
    intensity = number from 0 to 10;
}

for doom 2 first map level number equal to 1, since its the first map

intensity is time between spawning of new weather actors in tick
(greater numbers increase delaym smaler reduce)


next example set snow for any first map and rain for any second map of any wad
in all sectors which have sky "ceiling"
*/

map 1
{
    weather = snow;
    intensity = 1;
}

map 3
{
    weather = rain;
    intensity = 10;
}
